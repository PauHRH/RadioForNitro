# RADIO WITH NITRO STYLE
A fully functional radio with Nitro style.

This functional radio for nitro includes all what you need to make it work.

# HOW TO INSTALL
The radio is simple to install:
1. Download the file.
2. Open the file where you have the nitro client.
3. Copy all the code from the radio and paste it at the end of the nitro client.
4. Enjoy!
It comes a default radio, to change it search for "http://stream.zeno.fm/ha1xaksx0p8uv" and change it to your radio adress.

# NITRO NOTIFICATIONS
The radio will hide some notifications, to fix it:
1. Open the styles.[n√∫m].css file from Nitro.
2. Search for: ".nitro-purse-component{width:200px;pointer-events:none}".
3. Change the searched text before to ".nitro-purse-component{width:200px;pointer-events:none;margin-bottom: 33px;}" (or just add margin-bottom: 33px; at the end).
4. Ready!
This will also avoid the groups to be hidden with the radio.

<b>Not clear on how to change the styles.css?</b>
You have the file if you want to replace it with this done.

That's all. Thanks for using the radio. :)
